## ðŸ”­ Current Projects
- **[Palomino TownHomes](https://github.com/ReeceCrook/palomino-townhomes)**:
  - Commissioned by Masterbilt Homes, Inc. for their Palomino Homes Project, this is a website where users can view floorplans and townhomes for sale and find out more about the Palomino Homes community.
    
    - Utilized React.js and React Router to create an interactive and efficient UI.
    - Wrote custom CSS to create a desirable and dynamic UI.
    - Incorporated Formik and Yup for form validation.
    - Employed Google Maps JavaScript API to identify the location of the townhomes.

- **[Auto-Parts-Browser](https://github.com/ReeceCrook/Auto-Parts-Browser)**:
  - This project combines my passion for auto mechanics with my expertise in software engineering, showcasing both my technical skills and dedication to creating impactful solutions. As an auto enthusiast for years, I was inspired to develop a platform       that simplifies the process of finding and comparing auto parts, making it easier for users to locate what they need efficiently. This project is a testament to my commitment to delivering a high-quality product that merges functionality with my          personal interests. I am determined to make it a standout accomplishment in my portfolio.
  
    - Using the Google Places API, the site identifies auto parts stores within a specified radius based on the user's location or chosen area.
    - The site searches across the websites of these auto parts stores gathered from the API results, compiling their product listings into one convenient platform.
    - All listings are presented to the user in a centralized view, equipped with robust filtering and sorting options. Users can refine their search by criteria such as price, brand, availability, and distance to find the perfect match.
